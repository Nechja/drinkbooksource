# Pre 2014 Mana Potions

The Mana Potion. Such a magical drink. As I talked about in the previous post, this is the original AFK drink. That doesn't mean it's always been the same, however. Many versions, updates, and retools have seen their day in the sun.

Today we're going dive into the Pre 2014 Mana Potion backstories and some of the reasons behind the changes!
### Launch, Failure, and Irish Coffee

The Launch mana potion was problematic. Like the Alpha mana potion, it wasn't as much about the production speed and ended up getting scrapped fast. This version was from Nov 4, 2010, printing of the menu. I love archives because I barely remember this version. I've included the original description because it's cute.

Woah! That's a trip down memory lane—Irish coffee glass and making everyone run to the back fountain? Ah, what youthful ideas I had in 2010. So the Powerade came from, as you may have guessed it. Availability. The dropping of the black opal formula was actually by request of a bartender.  As it would look a lot like the drink "The Dark Side" from our original menu.

And so a legend was born, but this recipe was not long for the mortal world. In fact, this version would not last the first month before a trip for new plates would change the mana potion's face forever.
New Decanters and Hands blue, with the blood of smurfs

The back fountain was possibly the most problematic instruction of this drink, followed by the shaking it to just put it over ice again.  So we had already altered the drink to using Smurf's blood. A mix of 25% Sprite and 75% Powerade, or on some days a 50/50 mix. But the real game-changer was, of course, the Potion Bottle known in the industry as a small glass decanter.

I was out looking for better plates in the scratch and dent section of our local supply store when I first saw the small glass decanters. I was immediately in love—that real love between a bar owner and her relatively inexpensive glassware. Everyone knows those kinds of stories. It's like finding a cheap 3 door freezer. Anyhow, I bought a couple cases of them, and this changed the mana potion forever.

Due to the glass's volume change, we ditched the light ice, upped the Hpnotiq, and officially swapped over to smurfs blood. So the first potion bottle production version was as follows:

And with that, a legend was born. Photos of the mana potion ran wild on the internet. People called asking us wtf smurf blood was daily. I received emails asking about how we "made" the bottles. And a fair bit of hate mail for the color of the drink. It was fantastic; we knew we had a hit.

### On cost reduction, a generic substitution, and soda guns.

The first document I can find relating to the next version is in late 2011. At this point, we were shooting for price reduction but profit increase on the entire menu. One of our astute employees pointed out we could save some money swapping to generics in a few drinks. I recall writing it with Kara late after close one night. This 2011 version wasn't much different, but they helped shape the future of the drink.

However, the Shake & Strain was also dropped sometime around here. I'm not sure when my documents have some gaps here. But when we got Powerade on the front gun, it came out cold enough and was no longer required. Although some bartenders still did it for the Liquor parts of the drink as late as 2014. I did it often because I felt it was "better this way." However, in 2014 we actually had people try the difference, and no one could tell. So like many things in my life, I was wrong.

That's it for today! We'll get into the more modern versions next week. As well as the variants that existed from time to time. Thanks all for joining me on this adventure. It's been a rough week. But this has been a bright spot.
