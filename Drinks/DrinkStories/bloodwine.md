Klingon Bloodwine, yet another drink to join our menu in the first few months of AFK's operations. Like the Klingons, this has two different versions OG and TNG (I'm guessing now there might be more in Trek.) The Next Gen version comes in the iconic mug that is exceptionally close to the show's ones. I have included this [link right here](https://www.amazon.com/Winware-Aluminum-Measure-1-Quart/dp/B001CI8VA0) if you'd like to grab one for yourself. We found these mugs thanks to TJ due to his resourcefulness and attention to detail with Star Trek.
