The Onyxia was a classic AFK drink. It's sales spiked in the summer and was popular, not just among World of Warcraft fans but everyone. This drink had a broad fan base; I've spoken to many customers whose first introduction to AFK Drink's was the Onyxia.

Even though it joined the menu in 2013, I can't even picture the AFK menu without it. The Ony-kits in the shut down helped keep us going. Even it's modifications ended up as fantastic sellers, many sticking it out to the final days of service. The Onyxia was a hero drink for the Tavern, and it will always have a special place in my heart. Let's get into how to make it so it can make a special place in yours.

These were the most common version of the drink. The only real change came in during the shutdown when the only vodka we could get for the Ony-kits was Huckleberry Vodka. We ended up making a mixer that worked, and during limited operation, it joined our menu as a standard drink because people loved it. I still love it, it was one of the best things to come out of that time.

Throughout the years, the Onyxia gained quite a few variations. Some, like the Nefarian, were very long-lived, while others like the Alexstrasza were small blips.

The following were cut from release menus and left in drafts. We'll call the section the cutting room floor. There were some others from brainstorming docs, but I have had both of these, and they were good enough o be on the main menu.

_A fun final fact, the Sinestra was named after my cat Sinestra, not the WoW dragon._
