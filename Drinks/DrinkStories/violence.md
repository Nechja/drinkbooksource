# The Drink called #Violence

Why, you may ask, was there a drink called #Violence referencing some woman going "full auto" on the AFK Menu? To answer that, we need to talk about a weird AFK drink tradition and a little bit about a Role-Playing game.

AFK had a tradition of naming food and drink items vaguely after customers. Most of the time, it would reference a customer's name like the Dragonkight or a Steele's Torch. Sometimes it would be via a role-playing character, All Hail the GodKing, the Little Elven Rigger, the "Clan of the Rose," and many more. It came up at one point that I had never done one of these for myself. I owned a bar. Why don't we sell my drink? I pointed out that a short-lived drink called the Soul Reaper could be my reference. But, I agreed I should have something cool that was mine. Plus, one of my favorite things in the world was listening to people explain references wrong from the menu.

With that, I would, on the next printing of the menu, add #Violenceâ€”my drink. You see Violence, was my RPG character from a super villain's save the World FATE game. I'm not going to bore you with her backstory. I kept the flavor text open enough so people would be left guessing what #Violence was the reference was. Watching people insert their reasons for its existence brought me lots of entertainment over the years. As I have a torrid love affair with Long Islands, the drink was a Long Island mod. And because I was an ex-goth kid, it was close to a Black Opal.

Now every good Comic Book story-line has some alternate dimension nonsense happen to it. So that's how we got this cocktail's popular modification.

As every game comes to an end, I kept the tradition going with more modifications. This one was referencing an Exalted 3rd ed character. You want to make this one like a Sunrise.

And lastly, the last modification this drink ever saw. Based on my gaming group's favorite chain-smoking NPC.
