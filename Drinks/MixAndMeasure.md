## Measuring and Mixing Techniques Guide

## Measuring Ingredients

- **Ounces (oz):** Used for most liquid ingredients. Common amounts are 0.5 oz, 1 oz, 1.5 oz, and 2 oz.
- **Teaspoon (tsp):** A small measure used for potent ingredients. Equivalent to 1/6 oz.
- **Dash:** Approximately 1/8 teaspoon, often used for bitters.
- **Splash:** A very small, unmeasured amount, generally around 1/4 oz or less. Used for potent or finishing ingredients to add a hint of flavor without overpowering.
- **Fill:** Used to top off a drink with a mixer until the glass is full.
- **Fill Equal Parts:** Fill with a combination of ingredients in equal measures, typically used for mixers. For example, if filling with two mixers, add half of each until the glass is full.

## Tips:
- Use a jigger for accurate liquid measurements.
- For dashes and drops, pour carefully or use a dropper for consistency.
- For ingredients like muddled herbs or fruit, adjust measurements based on preference for intensity.
