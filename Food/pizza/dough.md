# AFK Pizza Dough
> By: Donald (ex-tavern cook)

Did you ever imagine the AFK kitchen looking like a battleground? Imagine flying pizzas flung at supersonic speeds crisscrossing the sky, and gloves fluttering to the ground, casualties of an oven explosion. I didn't until I saw it for myself. Alright, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but Kayla asked me to be entertaining, damn it.

I joined the Tavern to help improve consistency in our prep items. You might know my work, such as bringing back the thick french fries, making the chili badass, and ensuring your steaks were the right thickness. During my tenure, we had two different kinds of pizza dough; let's explore both of them, why they took so long to cook, and how you can best recreate them at home.

### The First Dough: Herb Dough

We stopped using this due to some equipment malfunctions that we never replaced. Start with five pounds of flour—though you'll likely need less unless you're feeding a restaurant!

#### Equipment Needed

- Your hands
- A metal bowl
- Measuring utensils
- Metal pie pan
- Oven

(Note: The type of pan we used was indeed a pie pan. Background info on ovens: Pizzas took long because our oven barely worked. We went through three in the time of making pizzas, and they are expensive.)

### Parm 'n' Rosemary Pizza Dough

- **Flour:** 18oz
- **Sugar:** 4tsp
- **Salt:** 2/3rd tsp
- **Yeast, active dry:** 1.5 tsp
- **Olive Oil:** 1oz
- **Rosemary:** 1 tsp
- **Parm:** 1/8th cup
- **Water (105°F):** 5.1oz

### The System is Down Pizza Dough

- **Flour:** 18oz
- **Sugar:** 4tsp
- **Salt:** 2/3rd tsp
- **Yeast, active dry:** 1.5 tsp
- **Olive Oil:** 1oz
- **Water (105°F):** 5 oz

#### Steps to Make Dough

1. Mince your rosemary and Parmesan cheese finely (use a blender, food processor, or coffee/herb grinder).
2. Dissolve yeast in the water, then combine with the rest of the ingredients.
3. Gently mix the yeast into your warm water to wake it up, then mix in the rest of your ingredients. If unsure about your yeast's freshness, proof it by mixing the sugar into your yeast and salt and letting it sit for 5-10 minutes. If it creates bubbles, you're good; if not, you need new yeast!
4. Mix by hand until combined, then knead on a lightly floured surface for 10-12 minutes until it springs back when lightly pressed.
5. Place the dough back in the bowl, let it rise covered on the counter until doubled in size, about an hour.
6. Divide into ~9oz balls, tucking the edges under to create a smooth surface.

#### Bonus Content

Kayla discovered a video while digging through archives for pizza-related content. It features Manager TJ teaching cooks how to make the pizza in the old days.
