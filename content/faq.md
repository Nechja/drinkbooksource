# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General questions

### Why did AFK close? I thought you were doing so well!
The short answer, and only one I can give you, is COVID hit us hard, and our lease was coming up. We decided to play dice with our fate, COVID it me (Kayla) personally pretty hard, and I stand by it as the best call for my health and the health of many others. 

#### I heard **-crazy theory-** was why you closed?! Are you sure it wasn't that?
I am sure it was COVID. Sorry, the story isn't grander.

#### Wait, the front page said NO CONTINUE?? Does this mean you're not opening back up?
You read that correctly. I will not be opening a new AFK Tavern anytime soon. You can find more about it in this [Public Post on my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/76658331).

#### So, if someone else opened up a Nerd Bar in the area, would you give them advice?
I actually do that often; you'd be shocked at how many people pm me to this day asking for advice. I even have other current and ex-nerd bar people to point you at. I might be jaded, but that doesn't mean I won't root for you, and help how I can.

#### I went there all the time! Can you put me in contact with **—name here—** a staff person?
No, sorry. I value people's right to privacy.
