**Welcome, traveler.** You have found the memorial website for AFK Tavern. This site exists to stand as a tombstone for the once-real Tavern. Here, you will find recipes, stories, and archives dedicated to its memory. 

I hope you find this useful as a glimpse of the Tavern that changed and influenced many lives. The Drink Book Patreon helped the archive project that put this site together; the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/kaylagraves) houses even more information and artifacts, many of which were made public, so if you'd like to check it out, hit the [link](https://www.patreon.com/kaylagraves). It also helped pay some ex-staff to create theme menus that stretched into 2021 to keep the magic going. 

When I closed the Tavern in 2020, many people were left without the chance to say goodbye. I know this is a far cry from one last drink at the bar, but hopefully, this will help some folks find closure after all these years. Putting it together helped me quite a bit.
