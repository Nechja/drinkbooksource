_...oh hello..._ it looks like a few people found this right quick. I've added a few more drink stories and a "last updated" tag on the main page and this page. An ex-afk-staffer has contacted me about updating drinks they've noticed are missing. Hooray! I'm happy to see so many people excited about this; truth be told, I wondered if many people would find this. It turns out many people found it.

Cool.

_...hi everyone..._
This mess is live! Same weekend I find another **160** drinks to add _mild panic_. Oh dear that's going to take me some time. Updates here happen over time, this site is live but is still a work in progress like...you know...I'm doing this in my spare time. My only hope is that someone enjoys this. If not, 🤷🏻‍♀️ that's also fine, you do you.
