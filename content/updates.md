Had an afternoon to myself, went and fixed some things that were annoying me on the site, and upgraded the sdk, did some stuff to make load times faster. Site needed some love after a year, we'll see if I find some time for more.

Oh hey...How's it going? I added some qol things folks asked for. Now the back arrow on drinks takes you back to your search. 🎉

_...oh hello..._ it looks like a few people found this right quick. I've added a few more drink stories and a "last updated" tag on the main page and this page. An ex-afk-staffer has contacted me about updating drinks they've noticed are missing. Hooray! I'm happy to see so many people excited about this; truth be told, I wondered if many people would find this. It turns out many people found it.

Cool.

_...hi everyone..._
This mess is live! Same weekend I find another **160** drinks to add _mild panic_. Oh dear that's going to take me some time. Updates here happen over time, this site is live but is still a work in progress like...you know...I'm doing this in my spare time. My only hope is that someone enjoys this. If not, 🤷🏻‍♀️ that's also fine, you do you.
